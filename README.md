# Arduino Project for Final Year Exam

This project was developed as a part of my final year in school and plays a crucial role in determining my exam results.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: SmartDoor
- **Course**: Electrical and Electronic Engineering

## Project Description

Innovating the way we secure our homes, this Arduino project introduces a revolutionary transformation. Unlike traditional door locks that rely solely on keys, this project redefines security by seamlessly integrating RFID card and passcode authentication. By doing so, it not only enhances convenience but also augments the level of protection.

Key Features:

RFID Card Access: Replace the antiquated key with modern RFID cards, ensuring swift and secure access to your home.

Passcode Entry: For added security, the system includes a passcode feature, allowing authorized users to input a unique code for access.

Buzzer Alert System: An intelligent buzzer system is integrated to promptly alert users in case of incorrect card swipes or passcode entries, ensuring the utmost security.

Experience the future of home security with this Arduino project, setting a new standard for door access control.
